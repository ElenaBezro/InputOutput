Morning session

Exercise 1: Write a Java program that reads a text file named "input.txt" using FileInputStream and displays its contents to the console.
Exercise 2: Enhance the program from Exercise 1 to handle exceptions gracefully. Implement error handling to catch and display any FileNotFoundException that may occur when attempting to read the file.
Exercise 3: Create a Java program that reads a binary file named "image.jpg" using FileInputStream and displays its content to the console. This exercise demonstrates reading binary data.
Exercise 4: Extend the program from Exercise 3 to create a new binary file named "copy_image.jpg" using FileOutputStream and write the content of "image.jpg" to the new file. Ensure that the new file is a copy of the original.
Exercise 5: Implement a program that reads a CSV file named "data.csv" using FileInputStream. Parse the CSV data and display it as a table in the console.
Exercise 6: Modify the program from Exercise 5 to handle exceptions. Implement error handling to catch and display any IOException that may occur while reading the file.
Exercise 7: Create a Java program that reads a large text file (e.g., "large_data.txt") in chunks using a buffer. Display the contents of the file in chunks, and specify the buffer size.
Exercise 8: Enhance the program from Exercise 7 to measure and display the time it takes to read the entire large file in milliseconds.
