Morning session

Exercise 1: Counting Words in a File
Create a Java program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it.

Bonus: Extend the program to display the frequency of each word in the text.

Exercise 2: Reading User Input until 'Exit'
Create a program where users can keep entering strings into the console. The program should terminate when the user types 'Exit'.

Bonus: Store all the entered strings in an ArrayList and, upon exit, write all the strings to a file named "userInputs.txt".

Exercise 3: Appending to a File
Create a program that allows the user to add more content to an existing file without overwriting its previous content.

Bonus: Before appending, check if the content already exists in the file. If it does, notify the user instead of appending.

Exercise 4: Reading a Properties File
Create a program that reads key-value pairs from a .properties file and prints them to the console.

Bonus: Allow the user to search for a specific key and display its corresponding value, notifying the user if the key doesn't exist.

Exercise 5: Creating Directories
Create a program that allows users to specify a path, and the program should create a directory at that specified location.

Bonus: Allow the creation of nested directories based on user input, like "folder/subfolder/subsubfolder".

Evening Session


Exercise 1
Create a Java program that collects the user's:

- name
- age
- email address
- phone number

Exercise 2
  Implement error handling to ensure that the age input is a positive
  integer.

  Q:
  What could go wrong if we didnâ€™t do this type of handling?

  Exercise 3
  Display the user's information in the console.

  Q:
  Where else could we display this? How?

  Exercise 4
Allow the user to input their address and write it to a text file using
FileWriter.

Exercise 5
    Read and display the user's name, age, email, and address from the file
    using FileReader.

    Q:
    What if the file is corrupted?
    What if the file is readable but not properly formatted?
    How can we prevent this?

    Exercise 6

    Implement a feature that calculates and displays the user's birth year
    based on their age and the current year.

    Exercise 7
    Create a function that allows the user to input their favorite book
    title, author, and publication year.

    Display this information alongside their name, age, and other data.

    Q:
    How do we structure the data about books?

    Exercise 8

    Create a function that validates the email address entered by the user
    to ensure it has a valid format (e.g., contains "@" and ".")

    Q:
    Is the validation implemented good enough? Is there a better way of
    doing it?

    Exercise 9

    Implement a feature that asks the user for their favorite color and
    displays it.

    Q:
    Could we pre-define colors and ask them to choose by not typing the
    color itself?

    Exercise 10

    Create a summary report at the end of the program that displays all
    the user's entered information, including name, age, email, phone
    number, birth year, gender, and favorite color.
