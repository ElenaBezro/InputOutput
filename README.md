Morning session

Exercise 1: Write a Java program that reads a text file named "input.txt" using FileInputStream and displays its contents to the console.
Exercise 2: Enhance the program from Exercise 1 to handle exceptions gracefully. Implement error handling to catch and display any FileNotFoundException that may occur when attempting to read the file.
Exercise 3: Create a Java program that reads a binary file named "image.jpg" using FileInputStream and displays its content to the console. This exercise demonstrates reading binary data.
Exercise 4: Extend the program from Exercise 3 to create a new binary file named "copy_image.jpg" using FileOutputStream and write the content of "image.jpg" to the new file. Ensure that the new file is a copy of the original.
Exercise 5: Implement a program that reads a CSV file named "data.csv" using FileInputStream. Parse the CSV data and display it as a table in the console.
Exercise 6: Modify the program from Exercise 5 to handle exceptions. Implement error handling to catch and display any IOException that may occur while reading the file.
Exercise 7: Create a Java program that reads a large text file (e.g., "large_data.txt") in chunks using a buffer. Display the contents of the file in chunks, and specify the buffer size.
Exercise 8: Enhance the program from Exercise 7 to measure and display the time it takes to read the entire large file in milliseconds.

Evening Session

Exercise 1
Extend your program to read and display the user's phone number
and address from the file using FileInputStream. Add error handling
for file input in case the file does not exist or is empty.
Exercise 2
Allow the user to update their email, phone number, and address in
the program, write it to the file, and display the updated information.
Exercise 3
Implement the ability to delete a user's information from the file if
requested by the user.
Exercise 4
Create a log file that records all user interactions with your program,
including timestamps.
Exercise 5
Implement a feature that allows the user to specify the name of the
file where their data will be stored and read from.
Exercise 6
Extend your program to read and display the user's favorite color
from the file.
Exercise 7
Add a confirmation step before updating or deleting user data to
ensure the user's intent.
Exercise 8
Create a function that calculates and displays the user's age category
(e.g., child, teenager, adult, senior) based on their age.
Exercise 9
Implement a feature that displays the total number of interactions
(e.g., how many times the program has been run) in the log file.

Musie Task:

Simple Text File Transformation
Objective: Use character streams to read data from a text file,
apply a simple transformation, and write the transformed data to a new text file.
Task:
Read the content of an input text file named "input.txt."
Transform the text in the following way:
Convert all text to uppercase.
Replace all occurrences of "JAVA" with "Python."
Write the transformed text to an output text file named "output.txt.‚Äù
