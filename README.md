Morning session

Exercise 1: Basic Object Deserialization
Objective:
Learn how to deserialize a simple Java object from a file.
Create a class called Person with fields for name (String) and age (int).
Serialize an instance of the Person class to a file.
Deserialize the object from the file and print the name and age.

Exercise 2: Array Deserialization
Objective:
Learn how to deserialize an array of objects from a file.
Create a class called Student with fields for id (int) and grade (double).
Serialize an array of Student objects to a file.
Deserialize the array from the file and print each student's id and grade.

Exercise 3: Handling Exceptions
Objective:
Learn how to handle exceptions during deserialization.
Modify the code from Exercise 1 to introduce a wrong file path intentionally.
Handle the FileNotFoundException and IOException appropriately.
Hints:   Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.

Exercise 4: Using transient Keyword
Objective:
Understand the use of the transient keyword in serialization.
Add a transient field named salary to the Person class from Exercise 1.
Serialize and then deserialize an object of the Person class.
Print the value of the salary field after deserialization.
Hints: Observe how the transient field is affected by serialization and deserialization.
